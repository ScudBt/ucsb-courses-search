This project will extend functionality of the
list view page of the UCSB Courses search, in regards to 
ability to add classes without sections. The list view page will also
give users more control over selected classes and provide 
more information.

Two major bugs are that classes without sections can't be added,
and lectures are not added with a section. These will be fixed.

For the list view, an improvement is to implement new sorting criteria. 

For the personal schedule view, improvements are
to display pass times, registration deadlines, and course final times;
also a functionality to add is the ability to remove courses.
