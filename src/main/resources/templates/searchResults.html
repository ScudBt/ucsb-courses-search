            In life you need colors. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. We have a fantastic little sky! All kinds of happy little splashes. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Fluff that up. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. Only eight colors that you need. Here's something that's fun. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. Mountains are so simple, they're hard. Use what you see, don't plan it. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Let's have a happy little tree in here.

            There it is. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. Just make a decision and let it go. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. You gotta think like a tree. It's all a game of angles. Just let these leaves jump off the brush You can spend all day playing with mountains. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. At home you have unlimited time. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Isn't that fantastic? I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. Just use the old one inch brush. We'll put a happy little bush here. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. All those little son of a guns. Let's get wild today. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around.
            
            But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. This is unplanned it really just happens. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. There we go. We'll play with clouds today. Just beat the devil out of it. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. With practice comes confidence. Brown is such a nice color. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Every day I learn.
            
            Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Do an almighty painting with us. A beautiful little sunset. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. That easy. It all happens automatically. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. Let's build an almighty mountain. This is a fantastic little painting. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. Let all these things just sort of happen. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Now then, let's play. All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. We'll do another happy little painting. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. Let your imagination be your guide. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. We don't have anything but happy trees here. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart.
            
            Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. Zip. That easy. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. And maybe a little bush lives there. A fan brush can be your best friend. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. A happy cloud. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. And right there you got an almighty cloud. We can fix anything. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. It takes dark in order to show light. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Let that brush dance around there and play.
            
            Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Happy painting, God bless. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. This painting comes right out of your heart. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. Everybody needs a friend. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Don't fight it, use what happens. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Let's do that again. Just a little indication. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. The least little bit can do so much. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen.
            
            The light is your friend. Preserve it. Anyone can paint. Let's have a nice tree right here. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. Poor old tree. Let your imagination be your guide. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. We need a shadow side and a highlight side. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Don't be bashful drop me a line. We'll have a super time. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Let's have a little bit of fun today. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. This is the fun part We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush.
